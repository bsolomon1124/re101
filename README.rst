re101
=====

A compendium of commonly-used regular expressions.

This module pertains specifically to regexes embedded inside Python and compiled with Python's `re
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html>`_ module.

.. code:: python

    >>> # Capture sequences following the
    ... # North American Numbering Plan (NANP) phone number format
    ... from re101 import nanp_phonenum

    >>> text = """
    ... Ross McFluff: +1 (834) 345.1254 155 Elm Street
    ... Ronald Heathmore: 892-345-3428 436 Finley Avenue
    ... Frank Burger: 541-7625 662 South Dogwood Way
    ... Heather Albrecht: 5483264584 919 Park Place"""

    >>> nanp_phonenum.findall(text)
    ['+1 (834) 345.1254', '892-345-3428', '541-7625', '5483264584']

----------
Disclaimer
----------

Use these regular expressions with care.  It is unlikely that any of them cover 100.00% of the cases that they are intended to cover.  They are built to handle "99.x%" of cases.  With all regular expressions, a balance must be made: covering an incremental 0.1% of cases often requires a large marginal amount of work and code.

If you do notice egregious mistakes or omissions, please consider submitting an issue or pull request.  See the "Contributing" file.

Categories of expressions that don't belong here include credit card patterns, passwords, and social security numbers, given that the only real purpose of having these is for malicious information retrieval.  You get the gist.

Please assume these expressions are "US-centric" unless noted otherwise.  For instance, the :code:`zipcodes` expression looks only for XXXXX or XXXXX-XXXX zip codes.

Notes
-----

It is recommended to import the module rather than its specific contents directly.  A handful of object names here may conflict with common modules or objects from Python's Standard Library.

For example, use :code:`import re101` with :code:`re101.email` rather than :code:`from re101 import email`, which could potentially conflict with Python's `email.py` module.

--------------------------------
Why use a full-blown repository?
--------------------------------

You might argue that this entire package could be thrown into a single GitHub gist.  Here's why I chose to structure `re101` as a Python package:

1. It makes version management and pushing updates much easier.  I'll do my best to keep a nice changelog with descriptions of added or modified expressions.
2. Easy setup and installation.  Just `pip install` and `re101` is added to `site-packages` within your path, making importing its objects hassle-free.
